   If you are a full time student you must reside in Leicester or within easy commuting distance of the city
   for the duration of each semester. All students are normally required to attend all learning and 
   teaching sessions associated with the course on which they are registered.</p><br><div class="divider" style=" border-bottom: 1px solid #888989;"></div><p><pre><h3>Absence: requests and notifications</h3> > It is the responsibility of every student to notify their home department of any absences from the University.
 > If you are unable to attend a class, tell your department/school office or your personal tutor straightaway.
 > When the absence is a result of illness of less than five days' duration you should complete and submit 
   <b>a self-certification form.</b>
 > Departments are empowered by <b>Senate Regulation 4</b> to authorise short absences for personal or religious
   reasons from campus-based courses
 > Requests for absences of more than one week must be explicitly in writing and will only be granted if 
   the department is in agreement with the proposal and you take full responsibility for the completion of 
   outstanding academic work<h3>Non-authorised absence</h3> > Students who are absent from compulsory teaching sessions without an accepted explanation risk disciplinary 
   action.
 > Your department will contact you after a period of non-authorised attendance, to advise the next steps, offer
   assistance and explain any action that may be taken. This will be conducted in accordance with the stages laid 
   out in the University's Policy on Attendance at Timetabled Teaching Events.<h3>If you are struggling to meet attendance requirements</h3> > Contact your personal tutor to discuss your situation if you are struggling to fulfil the attendance or any 
   other requirements of your course.
 > If your personal tutar is not available you can speak with your Head of Department or an appropriate member 
   of staff in the department/school office.</pre></p></div><div style="width: 27%;padding-left: 10px;float:right;padding-right: 26px; border: 3px solid white; border-radius: 5px; background-color: white;"><pre><p style="color: black;font-size: 15px;" ><b>Forms to download</b></p><p style="font-size: 15px;">> Self-certification form</p><p>  Let your Uni know if you have been absent for
